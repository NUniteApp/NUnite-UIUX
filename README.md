# NUnite-UIUX

This file contains all of the relevant work produced for the design sub-system of the NUnite project. The files should be view 
in order of the number that is in front of the file name I.E., 1.Requirement Capture should be the first file you open because 
it has number 1 at the front of it. 

The ‘Requirement Capture’ folder contains the all the data collected from participants in order to understand the design requirements. 
Four main methods were used: Think Aloud, SUS, Cognitive Walkthrough and Heuristic Evaluation. These are separated into file with the 
participants data inside each one. 

The word documents: ‘Pre-questionnaire’, ‘User Consent Form’ are both files related to what I needed 
in order to conduct the methods of capture and understand the initial requirements to be able start designing. 

The final file:‘Requirement Capture Analysis’ contains all of the data recorded and analyses it, showing you the findings of 
the requirement capture and conclusion of these findings. These findings show how effective the designs were and what was required 
for future designs.

The ‘NUnite Application Prototypes’ folder contains all of the prototype versions that I created for the applications design. It shows 
how the design iterations developed overtime with more information collected from participants. These were used as a reference point 
which the team could use to complete their parts also. 

The ‘Admin Panel Prototypes’ folder has all the versions of the admin panel 
prototypes used by the administrator to implement the admin panel. These versions show how the admin panel developed with collaboration 
with the administrator of the project. 

To intall the prototypes and view them and use them, you just need to use the 'NUnite prototypes' and 'Admin Panel Prototypes'
to locate the protypes and open them up using Adobe XD to be able to see and interact with them.
